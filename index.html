 <p>I'm an AI enthusiast with expertise in computer science, statistics and machine learning, theoretical and applied. I have worked with genetic data for cancer phenotype prediction. I have many years of hands-on experience with natural language processing methods based on transformer models, extending to large projects using cognitive AI (speech, text and image processing). Recently I have returned to the Healthcare industry, as lead of an ambitious team of data scientists in Teva Pharmaceuticals. We are focusing together on bringing the business closer to data-driven decisions.</p>
