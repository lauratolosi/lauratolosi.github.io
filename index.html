 <p>I have solid experience in data modeling, statistics and machine learning, both theoretical and applied. I have worked extensively with genetic data for ML-based cancer phenotype prediction. I am also an expert in natural language modeling with focus on semantic text analysis. Most recent interests are in reinforcement learning for time series prediction.</p>
